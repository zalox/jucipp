## About
Current IDEs struggle with C++ support due to the complexity of
the programming language. juCI++, however, is designed especially 
towards libclang with speed and ease of use in mind. 

## Features
* Platform independent
* Fast and responsive (written in C++)
* Syntax highlighting for more than 100 different file types
* C++ warnings and errors on the fly
* C++ Fix-its
* Debug integration through lldb
* Automated CMake processing, including support for external libraries
* Fast C++ autocompletion
* Keyword and buffer autocompletion for other file types
* Tooltips showing type information and doxygen documentation (C++)
* Rename refactoring across files (C++)
* Highlighting of similar types (C++)
* Automated documentation search (C++)
* Go to methods and usages (C++)
* Spell checking depending on file context
* Run shell commands within JuCi++
* Regex search and replace
* Smart paste, keys and indentation
* Auto-indentation of C++ file buffers through [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
* Source minimap
* Full UTF-8 support

See [enhancements](https://github.com/cppit/jucipp/labels/enhancement) for planned features.
